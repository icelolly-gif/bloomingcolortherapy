                    according to the principles of color therapy, certain colors tend
                    to specific emotional responses in people. Blues are calming,
                    greens are tranquil and grounding, yellows are cheerful, red is
                    passionate and romantic, pink promotes kindness and gentleness
                    , and purple inspires creativity and mystery.
