            BLUE FLOWERS
        </h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        Blues are a color that’s a bit challenging to come by in the gardening world.
        The two best flowers for featuring true blues are Forget-me-nots and Himalayan
        Blue Poppy. Unfortunately, Himalayan Blue Poppies are extremely difficult to 
        grow and are pretty hard to come by. Luckily for us, Forget-me-nots are much more 
        forgiving, and they deliver a whole batch of pretty little blue flowers from spring
        to summer. They’ll do well in full sun or part shade, and should naturalize well 
        in your landscape.
